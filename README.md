# IMPOSSIBLE Button

This project features an "impossible" button that tries to evade the user's cursor whenever they attempt to click on it. It's a fun and interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Evasive Button**: The button on the webpage moves away from the cursor whenever the user tries to click on it, making it difficult to click.
- **Alert**: When the user tries to click on the button, an alert message "Nice Try" is displayed.
- **Window Closure**: After displaying the alert message, the window closes automatically.

## Usage

To experience the "impossible" button, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Hover your cursor over the button.
3. Attempt to click on the button.
4. Notice how the button moves away from your cursor whenever you try to click on it.
5. After a click attempt, an alert message "Nice Try" will be displayed.
6. The window will then close automatically.

## Code Explanation

- **CSS**: The CSS code positions the button on the webpage and defines its appearance.
